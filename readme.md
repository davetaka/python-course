### notes
* can multiply strings like 'a' * 3 == 'aaa'  
* recommended snake case for variables like first_name
* True/False with uppercase first letter
* float for numbers with decimal places
* three quotes (""") for string like @" in C#
* (//) division operator to get integer part like floor
* a module is a separate file with some reusable code, to organizing code in different files
* [math module used in course](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)
* else if = elif
* basically "then" keyword or the open "{" in python is ":" (this note will help me to remember)
* unfortunately the logical operators' syntax remembers me of asp 3.0, microsoft's classical asp
* exists an else in while loop that will be executed only when the while loop reach all executions without a break
* tuples are immutable in python
* dictionary is the variable form of classes (with json format)
